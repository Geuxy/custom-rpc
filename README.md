**IMPORTANT: THE JAR ONLY WORKS IF YOU RUN IT THROUGH A TERMINAL!**

# How to build the JAR
Use the maven task: **package**.

If you get a error that the main class cannot be found after building the JAR, follow these steps:
open the JAR with an application like 7Zip or Ark, go to META-INF and open MANIFEST.MF, then add "Main-Class: Main".
Once you saved the file, you can run it!

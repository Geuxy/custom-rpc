**IMPORTANT: THE JAR ONLY WORKS IF YOU RUN IT THROUGH A TERMINAL!**

# How to build the JAR
Use the maven task: **package**.

I am also extremely stupid when it comes to the MANIFEST, for some reason it wont set the Main Class.
To fix it, open the JAR with an application like 7Zip or Ark, go to META-INF and open MANIFEST.MF, then add "Main-Class: Main".
Once you saved the file, you can run it!
